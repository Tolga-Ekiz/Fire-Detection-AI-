# Fire-Detection-AI-
Term Project of EEE-485 Statistical Learning and Data Analytics course, Bilkent University. 

A machine learning-based fire classification system for detecting and alerting the presence of fires.

## Dataset
- Utilizes information collected from a variety of smoke detection sensors.

Download the dataset from the following link:
- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/smoke-detection-dataset)


Key Futures: 
- PCA algorithm was used for dimensionality reduction.
- Implemented Logistic Regression and Feed Forward Neural Networks to predict whether there is a fire or not.

### All of the models were created from scratch with no usage of machine learning libaries.
