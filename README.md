# Fire-Detection-AI-
Term Project of EEE-485 Statistical Learning and Data Analytics course, Bilkent University. 

A machine learning-based fire classification system for detecting and alerting the presence of fires.

- Utilizes information collected from a variety of smoke detection sensors.

Key Futures: 
- PCA algorithm was used for dimensionality reduction.
- Implemented Logistic Regression and Feed Forward Neural Networks to predict whether there is a fire or not.

### All of the models were created from scratch and no machine learning libaries were used.
